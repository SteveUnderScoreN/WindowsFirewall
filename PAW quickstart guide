To deploy the minimum policies required for a privileged access workstation download this repository as a zip and extract the following  
to C:\Temp\;
 - Domain Root/Update-DomainFirewallBaseline.ps1
 - Domain Root/Admin/Tier X/Devices/Update-TierXFirewallBaseline.ps1 
 - Domain Root/Admin/Tier X/Devices/Update-ServerRoleRemoteAdministrationFirewallBaseline.ps1 
 - SN-GPO.zip
 
Extract 'SN-GPO.zip' (The files should now be located in C:\Temp\SN-GPO\).
On a computer that has the Group Policy Management Console installed review the domain resources variables in one script and copy them to  
the other scripts, the minimum requirements are the domain controllers names/IP addresses and the proxy server port.
Run each script and review the GPO's created. Apply all policies to the 'Domain Root/Admin/Tier 0/Devices' OU
These policies are designed to be used inconjunction with the Microsoft baselines found [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/)
