I'm putting together a script to collect security events from a domain joined system, analyse them and generate rules which can then be
applied to an existing group policy object.
The rule generation will make recommendations and provide security advice around the type of rule being created.
I'm planning to use a GUI so that rules can be modified with a drop-down so the script will not be supported over remoting.
