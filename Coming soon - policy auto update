I've modified the existing script to use the "Group" parameter that matches the domain resources defined. This allows me to have a rule to
set new parameter values on all rules that are in a specific group, for example;

I have 35 rules that have domain controllers as the destination IP address
I change the IP address of a domain controller which is updated in DNS
I add an IPv6 address to an existing domain controller which is created in DNS
I have a new domain controller at a new site and the address is created in DNS
I update the $DomainControllers variable to add the new server name along side the existing server names
I run the script against the GPO with the 35 rules
The script converts $DomainControllers from the names of the servers to an array of IP addresses
The script detects the existing GPO and presents a menu to select the "Update existing" option
When selected the script, with 1 line, updates all 35 rules that have the group as "DomainControllers"
The GPO is then saved back to the domain and is ready to be applied

This is in branch "Post 1803" and will be merged into master in the next few weeks.
